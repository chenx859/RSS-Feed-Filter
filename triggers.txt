# The example file specifies that five triggers should be created, and that two of those triggers 
# should be added to the trigger list:
# A trigger that fires when a title contains the word 'Obama' (t1).
# A trigger that fires when the summary contains the word 'China' and the news item contains the phrase 
#'Shanghai stocks' somewhere (t4).
# The two other triggers (t2 and t3) are created but not added to the trigger set directly. 
# They are used as arguments for the composite AND trigger's definition (t4).

# title trigger named t1
t1 TITLE Obama

# summary trigger named t2
t2 SUMMARY China

# phrase trigger named t3
t3 PHRASE Shanghai stocks

# composite trigger named t4
t4 AND t2 t3

# the trigger set contains t1 and t4
ADD t1 t4
